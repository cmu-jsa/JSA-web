This Year, we are proud to present Keio University's Otoha to perform some shamisen melodies at Matsuri. Otoha (弦音巴) is a music group dedicated to the arts of the Tsugaru Shamisen. Originating from the northern Tsugaru region in Japan's Aomori Prefecture, it is different from normal shamisen in that the instrument's necks are much wider, creating a larger auditory impact. Please join us on April 11th to hear more about the unique Tsugaru-Shamisen!",/matsuri/,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/958230877531643904/PG6b7kNv_400x400.jpg,0
