The Red feather Central Community Chest of Japan is a non profit organization that raises donation for natural disasters that happened in Japan. 

The organization was established as the nation's first private social welfare campaign after WWII, starting with helping those affected by the war. Through the years, the community chest has helped many people in Japan, collaborating closely with local people to effectively support as many people as efficiently as possible. To this date, the organization has received a total of 943.3 billion Japanese Yen, which helped increase the scope of impact it has had on the people living in Japan. 

We decided to donate our money raised from Matsuri to this organization as many many people, including members of CMU JSA, were greatly impacted by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.
