# Cause

This year we are holding Matsuri to continue to raise awareness about the Asian identity in the United States. In the past JSA had held the event for causes in Japan, but this year, with the COVID-19 Pandemic bringing more local issues to light, we thought it best to contribute to a Japanese charity within the United States. 

All excess profits from this event will be donated to the Japanese American Citizens league, or JACL. JACL's goal is to safeguard the civil and human rights of Asian and Pacific Islander Americans and all communities who are affected by injustice and bigotry. The leaders and members of the JACL also work to promote and preserve the heritage and legacy of the Japanese American Community.

## Advocacy:
JSA believes that Asia is a diverse continent and should be viewed as such. We condemn the horrific violence committed against Asian American throughout the pandemic. This hate arises from a view of Asia as a monolithic continent, which in turn dehumanizes individual people. We plan to donate revenues from Matsuri to organizations that inform people of diversity and contemporary issues within the entire Asian continent.
