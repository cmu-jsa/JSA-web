# Cause

This year we chose to hold Matsuri with two causes in mind, helping the local Japanese restaurant community in Pittsburgh and raising awareness about the Asian identity in the United States. In the past we have held the event for causes in Japan, but we made the choice this year to focus on issues that affect our local community instead.
