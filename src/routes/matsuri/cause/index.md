# Cause

This year we chose to hold Matsuri with two causes in mind, helping the local Japanese restaurant community in Pittsburgh and raising awareness about the Asian identity in the United States. In the past JSA had held the event for causes in Japan, but this year, with the COVID-19 Pandemic bringing more local issues to light, we thought it best to contribute to local businesses, and charities within the United States. 
 
## Businesses:
Local Japanese restaurants and stores are suffering greatly due to the Pandemic. To assist these businesses, weâ€™ve decided to help pay for part of your meal at one of many Japanese restaurants across the city. Find out more in our [Food Section](../restaurants).
 
## Advocacy:
JSA believes that Asia is a diverse continent and should be viewed as such. We condemn the horrific violence committed against Asian American throughout the pandemic. This hate arises from a view of Asia as a monolithic continent, which in turn dehumanizes individual people. We plan to donate revenues from Matsuri to organizations that inform people of diversity and contemporary issues within the entire Asian continent.
