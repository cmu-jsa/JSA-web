## About

Originally a sacred ceremony of the Shinto belief, 
now a day full of street food, games, and joyful performances, 
Matsuris are of great importance to the Japanese people, its culture, and its tradition.

We want to share a snippet of this eventful festival here in Pittsburgh, 
right on the Carnegie Mellon campus, and this year across the world as well! Try a taste of authentic Japanese food,
play traditional games and enjoy a range of performances all from the comfort of your home!

Although 2021 has presented its fair share of challenges to running Matsuri, we are excited to give you the Matsuri experience
no matter where you are, from Pittsburgh to Tokyo, via a virtual setting.  Our goal is to offer the same cultural experience we’ve offered in the past, centered around food, performances, and games, while tackling and raising awareness about relevant issues that have surfaced on the local and national level due to COVID in the past year.
We hope that you will enjoy this one of a kind Matsuri experience!

## Theme: 交流
### What is 交流？
The word 交流 (kōryū) means “exchange” or “coming together”, but it can also mean “confluence”. Like the confluence of Pittsburgh’s three rivers, culture is a dynamic exchange of arts, traditions, food and language, among other things. We view the culture of Japan, and the culture of the Asian continent as a confluence of many different elements. 

### どこからでも交流しよう！
### Wherever you're from, let's come together!

This year’s virtual Matsuri allows people to come together all over the world, not just in the City of Pittsburgh. Our goal is to celebrate what makes us unique, while fostering global friendship. 

## Why

Our Matsuri this year has been profoundly affected by recent events, and as a result, this year's Matsuri has been developed around the idea of an exchange of culture, to educate and enrich those at CMU, Pittsburgh, and communities all over.
