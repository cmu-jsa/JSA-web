## About

Originally a sacred ceremony of the Shinto belief, 
now a day full of street food, games, and joyful performances, 
Matsuris are of great importance to the Japanese people, its culture, and its tradition.

We want to share a snippet of this eventful festival here in Pittsburgh, 
right on the Carnegie Mellon campus, and this year across the world as well! Try a taste of authentic Japanese food,
play traditional games and enjoy a range of performances all from the comfort of your home!

Although 2021 has presented its fair share of challenges to running our Matsuri, we are excited to give you the Matsuri experience
no matter where you are, from Pittsburgh to Tokyo. This year, in addition to our games and performances, we are hoping to give back
to Japanese restaurants throughout Pittsburgh by sponsoring a discount program for any food you purchase from select establishments.
We hope that you will enjoy this one of a kind Matsuri experience!

We are also proud to announce that the profits we make at this event will be 
donated to the Red Feather Community Chest in Japan. 
The organization helps people affected by natural disasters all over Japan. 

We will be updating this page with more information soon, so stay tuned for all the fun Matsuri 2021 will have to offer!
