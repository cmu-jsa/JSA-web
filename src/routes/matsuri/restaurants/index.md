# Restaurants

This year, recognizing the hardships that local Japanese restaurants have faced and are still facing, we are selling care packages with discounts for select Japanese restaurants for Matsuri 2021! Are you interested in trying new Japanese snacks and get FREE RAMEN from Fujiya Ramen? Then this care package is for you ðŸ™‚

## What's in the care package?

JSA's Matsuri care package includes: a redeemable FREE RAMEN from Fujiya Ramen, Pocky, Hello panda, Potato chips, a ramune drink, and cup noodles for only 12 dollars!!! That's cheaper than just buying ramen ðŸ˜®

## When can I get my care package?
We will be handing out care packages in front of the Conan room at the UC on Friday, April 9th, from 2-6pm: https://forms.gle/rGyMifeKqadzC8b46
This offer is limited for the first 45 people who sign up, so hurry up and secure your spot!
You can also win FREE SUSHI from sushi fuku here (https://forms.gle/pdZiPJAH4NeQmtFCA), or commenting on our instagram post.
