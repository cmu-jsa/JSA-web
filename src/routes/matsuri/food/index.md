This year, recognizing the hardships that local Japanese restaurants have faced and are still facing, 
we are running restuarant incentive program for 2021 Matsuri! When you buy from one of the listed restaurants below,
we will provide you with a discount given you follow the instructions under the "Discount Process" section.

We will also be selling food in the UC on campus on April 9th. Please check back later for more information.
