export const MujinDescription = `Mujin is a company which develops and sells "intelligent robot controllers," designated as a common platform for industrial robots. Conventional robots, even though they are suitable for the automation of repetitive work, were difficult to install in environments where handled products and the surroundings are liable to change, due to the robots’ operations differing by manufacturer and the complex settings. Mujin has solved this problem using technology called motion planning, and is providing solutions in which heavy/simple work done by humans at the logistics/manufacturing scene are automated by robots.

Mujin is proud to be based in Japan, a country with some of the highest manufacturing standards and the most deployed automation systems in the world. Here you will use and create cutting-edge tools and processes for real world robotics deployment.
